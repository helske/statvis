","The shape is quite distracting, and changing both width and color intensity at the extremes is misleading - \"amount of ink is not proportional to probability\"","Same information as the simple plot, but takes more ink. ","I sometimes used fading-color bars to indicate (one-sided) uncertainty... color intensity proportional to P(true mean > this number) and have found them effective. (It makes people guess where the middle is, rather than presenting mean as \"truth\".) I DONT like having the whole region from 50% to 95% shown exactly the same way."],"rank":["2","1","4","3"]}

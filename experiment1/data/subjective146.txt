{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["clean for a single effect, but highly problematic if trying to compare effects.","Very clear for the chosen confidence level, but leaves us really guessing for other confidence levels.","The very thin tails make it very difficult to see the gradient. ","Good for seeing the gradient, which more clearly relays the p-value information.","There's more to the hypothetical study than just our confidence in whether the effect is positive or not. I tend to prefer the graphical displays because it is a bit better at providing more of the other information (i.e., effect size) that we might be interested in. And it has much greater benefits when you are interesting in comparing across different treatment effects. "],"rank":["4","2","3","1"]}

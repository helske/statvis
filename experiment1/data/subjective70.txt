{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["Benefit: Exact values are provided. Negative: Without visualisation, it can be slower to interpret the values.","Benefits: Clear indication of mean and CIs. Negatives: No information about distribution ","Benefit: Provides more information than the other graphs that helps in the interpretation. Negative: Seeing exactly at which values the 95% CI occurs is not as easy as when a line is used.","Benefit: Provides additional information on the tails compared to just having the CIs. Negative: The fading colour is not necessarily so clear and estimating the exact value of the 95% CI is not as easy as when there is a line.","The ideal situation in my opinion would be to provide the \"violin\" type plot with exact mean and CI values indicated on the figure."],"rank":["4","2","1","3"]}

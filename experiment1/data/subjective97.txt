","Limitations: does not state p-value. Cannot see other alpha level CI. Really there is no benefit to this than just stating the mean, CI, and p-value. This takes up more room than just stating values.\nBenefits: visual assessment is better than just stating numbers.","Limitations: not commonly used and maybe not commonly understood. Does not state p-value.\nBenefits: looks like a density curve which we are all familiar with. The shape of this CI makes it seem like the likelihood of the mean being 0 or less is quite lower than you would actually think. Can see other alpha level CIs.","Limitations: Not commonly used in literature. Makes 0 seem like a likely mean.\nBenefits: can see other alpha level CIs. ","Thank you!! This is very interesting."],"rank":["2","1","4","3"]}

{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["the p value can foster dichotomous thinking (an inferential cliff at 0.05).  Also, text seems inherently more limited than visualization","I don't mind using bare CIs.  I think it is helpful to follow Cumming's suggestion to leave off the end caps so as not to suggest firm limits.  This is not as informative as the gradient options, but on the other hand I know that imposing a distribution on a frequentist CI is somewhat controversial, so this approach at least avoids the possibility of having to reply to nasty emails from Richard Morey.","This is pretty good, but I actually found the rectangular plot more useful.  Not sure if it was a practice effect or not.  ","i didn't think I'd like this much, but it actually seemed easier to calibrate judgements than with the cat's eye plot.  It was like judging the water level in a container--it was easier with a rectangular water container than with a container of varying width.","The question to be judged was \"certain there is an effect\".   That's fine, but I think a more ethologically relevant research question is \"certain there is an effect of a meaningful size\" (or something like that).  In that type of thinking, one would have to have a ROPE pre-defined or at least some strong familiarity with the research scale and question to make the judgement of clinical significance.  So that may have been too complex for this study.  But still, to my mind the best visualizations will help us find meaningful (and replicable effects).  So, for example, when the 95% CI just scrapes 0 I may be 95% confident there there is \"some\" effect (of any non-zero value)... but that doesn't mean I should be 95% confident the effect will be replicable or meaningful... so it'd be lovely to test these for calibrating judgements about confidence that a meaningful effect has been identified."],"rank":["4","3","2","1"]}

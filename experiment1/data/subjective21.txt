Requires some effort to assess the confidence interval (e.g. width of interval in relation to distance from zero).","Simple representation of values is a benefit. A possible limitation is that it might be confused with other visual indicators such as the range of values.","A benefit is that it reminds you that there is an assumed underlying distribution of sample mean values, which emphasizes the arbitrariness of the 0.05 cutoff. A limitation is that it might overstate the ideal nature of the distribution and that it might be interpreted as the sample distribution density. ","A benefit is that it reminds you that there are no sharp cutoffs. A limitations is that the edges becomes fuzzy so that it is harder to see what values are actually represented.",""],"rank":["2","1","3","4"]}

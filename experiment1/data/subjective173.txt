However, this approach is less visually intuitive than mean-and-whiskers visualizations.","Visually familiar and intuitive - if then whiskers do not overlap the zero, the P value is below 0.05. However, this visualization technique makes it difficult to assess whether the underlying data is actually normally distributed. I prefer visualizations that show the data distribution (individual points in smaller samples).","This format seems to visualize the underlying statistical assumptions in a way that emphasizes the unlikelihood of results that deviate extremely from the mean. On the downside, this visualization also risks being interpreted as a histogram of sorts, which it is obviously not.","It seems to overemphasize the 95 % limit (which is arbitrary) and says nothing about the underlying assumptions.",""],"rank":["3","1","3","4"]}

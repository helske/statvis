Further, a p-value of say 0.06 would make me question or wonder about the HT.","Black and white which is good because its easy to infer, but its hard to judge the variability of the estimate","Gives an estimate of probability, but the shape and skinny tails make it hard to infer from color","Easy to see how far away from 0 the interval is, but hard to see the cutoff","Great experiment. This is something I think about often. Looking forward to reading the results."],"rank":["4","3","2","1"]}

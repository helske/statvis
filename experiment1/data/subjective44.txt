{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["Limitation:\n- It's tough to picture the CIs mentally. Thus, it takes more time to analyze the results.\nBenefit:\n- I can use the p-value to make sure my analysis of the CIs makes sense.","Limitation:\n- Although I was taught that when the CI crosses the zero it means there's no significant change, otherwise there's a significant change, every time the CI is very close to zero but doesn't touch it, I question myself what I can consider as a reliable result.\nBenefit:\n- It's much easier to identify the CIs in comparison to the written format.","Limitation:\n- It's not a typical chart. However, I think this format is promising to report CIs\nBenefit:\nI feel more confident to report the results because the format is continuous. If only the \"tail\" of the chart touches the zero, I am more confident to say it's likely not to have a change.","Limitation:\n- The fade made me confused about the results\nBenefit:\n- I can see the CIs visually",""],"rank":["4","2","1","3"]}

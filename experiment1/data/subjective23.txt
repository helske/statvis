For the colour shades, see above, I think it is worthless.","I see no benefits at all in the green colouring, it kind of reifies the 95% threshold and as such suggests importance of (ultimately arbitrary) threshold choices","I hope to see consistency of my answer patterns over the 4 methods on the next page. Feedback is always nice :-)\n\nWhat I do not like about all 4 methods is their reliance on the law of large numbers for independent sampling. Why not add a violin-type plot based on Bayesian posterior distributions? This could also be applied for more complex evidence and data that do not lend themselves to application of asymptotic theory."],"rank":["4","3","1","2"]}

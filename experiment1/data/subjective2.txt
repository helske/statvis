{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["A drawback is that this representation requires more mental work to interpret the data and results.  A good thing is that it provides exact values. This is information that often is combined together with one of the representations below, to highlight important findings. Therefore, I do not necessarily consider it to \"compete\" with the other representations. ","The major benefit is that it illustrates the spread in a good way and that it requires little space. A drawback is that it does not reflect how responses varied along the 95%. ","A benefit is that the representation is richer (provides more information) than the other representations. Moreover, it is easy to understand and attractive to look at. \nAnother benefit is that it can allow for combining a plot representation with a histogram representation. It can be highly misleading if this is not the case. The representation may also take different shapes depending on how data is distributed. A homogenous representation, as the one illustrated, is not likely to be found in reality.  \nIt may be less suitable for datasets with many variables. ","The only benefit is that it is a bit more attractive to look at compared to the basic plot (above). It is less useful for a dataset with several variables compared as there will be too many \"bars.\" ","It would be nice if the representations also contained information on the 50% cutoff (i.e. quarters), like a conventional box plot.

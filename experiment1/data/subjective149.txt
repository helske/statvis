{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["Great to see the p-value, needs to also mention the sample size. Harder to interpret than a plot.","Easy to read, gives an idea of a mean, CI, overlap w/ no effect line. Limitation: only shows the 95%CI.","Violin plots are often used to show the distribution of the data in the sample, not the CI, so easy to confuse the two.","Unclear why transparency only starts at 95+, decays too quickly. Not standard in the field, so have to think about interpretation.",""],"rank":["4","1","2","3"]}

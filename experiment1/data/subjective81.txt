However, the plot is relatively simple and clean, and allows many estimates to be easily compared.","This is an uncommon way of displaying confidence intervals, and lay people may not understand what the distributions represent. However, for a trained statistician the correspondence of area to p-value is somewhat appealing.","The meanings of the colors are not shown, so it is difficult to tell where the, e.g., 97.5% CI falls. The plot also takes up a substantial amount of room and is not commonly seen in practice.",""],"rank":["2","1","3","4"]}

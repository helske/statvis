If one wants to put in effort in solving above, the benefit is that it is exact.","Kind of the same as the numbers - it is easy to care too much about the end-points of the line. But I guess that is also the benefit, that the end-points are clear.","I dig this. The problem of the relationship with the flat blurry one, vanishes here. It is novel, at least to me. It focuses on the distribution not some single threshold value. The reverend would be very happy.","Takes a few to get used to. It is a bit confusing since the prob. mass is not the same across the whole spectrum, that is the relationship between the proportion of green/blurry and probabilities is confusing. But it is quite good-looking. If that is what one wants.","Although I've ranked them the border-line is not hard between them. But since I have to rank, this is that.\n\nGood and fun experiment!"],"rank":["2","3","1","4"]}

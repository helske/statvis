{"labels":["pvalue","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["The benefits are to the extent that it answers a question in relation with a null hypothesis. Negative aspect is that I need to imagine the CI first to assess quality fully. I ended though not always as confident of my confidence.","I like this one a lot. The mean as a dot might become undermined though compared to the length of the bar.","I did not like it as much because the shape confused me. As I understand it, the shape tries to emphasize the intensity of the color lore clearly, but for me it is enough with the intensity of the color.","I liked this one the most for two reasons: first, the mean is represented as a line, and it is better grasped visually. Second, the intensity of the color is a good clue for assessing when one can stop looking at the length of the bar.","I like the errorbar and the rectangle because I can easily take the mean and the zero dotted line as reference points and then use the length of the bars to see the position of the estimates in reference to these points. Perhaps the shade of the color also helps in assessing when I can stop looking at the extreme of the bars.\n\nAbout the experiment (I used a smartphone with Android and Firefox): (a) at the very beginning I did not see that clicking \"next\" had any effect because I could not see that the dotted line was changing. Consider putting an extra signal that you turned to the next question, like a page counter or sth like that; (b) the text boxes can't be enlarged and so it is a little bit uncomfortable to revisit what I typed.\n\nHope that this might be useful. Thanks!"],"rank":["4","2","3","1"]}

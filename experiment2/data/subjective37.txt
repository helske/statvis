{"labels":["violin2","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["This one was really nice, as it had a range of CI and the plot tailed off at the end. This made me think \"we are pretty sure that the mean will somewhere in the dark green, but we can't rule out the tiny faint green slivers.\" Potentially the tailing off at the end could make one think that the differences are bigger than they actually are (though maybe it's just making the true difference more clear). ","Having only the 95% CI is very limited after being exposed to these other plots. With there just being lines, you don't get an idea of where the lower CIs would lie. I think you end up focusing on where the two dots (means) are and how much distance there are between the CI, but you put everything into there not being overlap of the CI. Also, after seeing the other plots, it seems that you are actively excluding data if you just show these plots. ","This seemed pretty comparable to the other violin plots, but I think the explicit intervals were helpful. The box gradient plots were a bit easier to see the actual gradient. For these, by the time the gradient started it's almost impossible to actually determine how faint the green. ","I liked this one because it biased me less towards a big difference than the violin plots and you could clearly see the gradient with discretely different colors/CI's labeled. I felt the differences were smaller when looking at these gradient plots, likely because the plots didn't tail off at the higher CI. ","I really enjoyed this survey, I definitely learned a lot! Best of luck with the study, looking forward to seeing your results!"],"rank":["1","4","3","2"]}

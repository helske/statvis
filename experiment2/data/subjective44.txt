{"labels":["violin2","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["Very unfamiliar, requires colour gradation legend, difficult to line up/compare the CIs of adjacent sets (let alone many samples)","Familiar, very easy to read, though only shows 95%CI, allows comparison of many samples at once","This is easier to read than the graph option with multiple gradation indicators.  However, it is still more difficult to compare samples than with the simple whisker plot.","Just having colour as a visual cue is not as helpful as also having the size changes in the violin plots, though the benefit is that the line between 95%CI and greater is clearer",""],"rank":["3","1","2","4"]}

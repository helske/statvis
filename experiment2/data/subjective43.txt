Might be. Therefore last.","I do understand, that getting less wide violins the further away from the mean you get, provides the understanding that the probability to end up there gets smaller, but through that it adds complexity.","I like the simplicity and clarity. But suggests equal probability of getting an outcome over or below the mean. Does not provide information about the density distribution. But it is simple and provides a balance between information provided.",""],"rank":["3","4","2","1"]}

{"labels":["violin2","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["So unused to think of the \"lowest\" level of confidence as 80%. Immediately thought it was 95% and up before closer inspection.\n\nThat said, I prefer the discrete nature of the steps that the confidence level takes as opposed to the \"gliding\" scale. I think it would be very uncommon for me to know a 97.4% confidence interval, for instance, so the discrete options works better for me. If I am interested in more details about if it's a significant result or not, I would perform a hypothesis test and get a p-value. That would contain the \"continous\" information I seek, so to speak. ","Clearest and purest form. Easiest to read in printed form too, since the it is not color depth dependent. Sure, you only get one confidence level here, but I'm of the school that confidence levels should be decided on beforehand and not in a post-hoc fashion. More information in a plot is not always better, in my opinion.","A vast improvement from the \"dissolving box\" one, or whatever it is called. I like this visually a lot better.","Hard on the eyes to look at. Almost like looking at something that's out of focus.","Best of luck with your study! I feel your pain when it comes to collecting the data. :)"],"rank":["2","1","3","4"]}

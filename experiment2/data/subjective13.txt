{"labels":["violin2","ci","violin","gradient","comments"],"feedback":["Benefits: in addition to clearly illustrare mean and CI, the width of the format provides additional information that the other format lacks. Limitaitons: the width suggests a normally distributed sample, which often is not the case.","Benefits: Good and simple. Limnitations: although adding boxes for the quarter intervalls would be benefitial. ","Similar to the cat eye plots with CI information. The lack of CI is also a limitation. ","Limitations: uneccessary to present bar widths. Take too much space.","When comparing graphs, ideally all scales should be representera equally to allow for better comparison. Also, scales should reflect meaningful differencess. E.g., is less than 1 kg in average difference between groups a meaningful weight difference? Perhaps not."],"rank":["1","3","2","4"]}
